## Summary
I plan to use this space to document all the stuff I find myself working on in my spare time. I realize no one is going to read this, but someone recently told me that I should document all of my side projects, so here we are. 

## Things I am currently interested in:
- 3D Printing
- 3D Design
- Docker/containerization
- Monitoring/graphing tools
- Automation tools
- What I call "general home lab nonsense"

## Current and past projects can be found [HERE](/projects.md)

## List of software/tools/etc that I use can be found [HERE](/stuffiuse.md)

## Check out stuff I created:
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ccmpbll)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ccmpbll)

## Check out my resume [HERE](/resume.md)
