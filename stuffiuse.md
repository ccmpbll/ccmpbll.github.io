## 3D Printing and Design
- Printer - Prusa MK3S+
- Slicer Software - PrusaSlicer and SuperSlicer
- 3D Design/CAD - Fusion360
- Digital Calipers - [Neiko 01407A 6in Stainless Steel Digital Calipers](https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Electronic-Digital-Stainless/dp/B000GSLKIW/) - Yes you can buy better calipers, but not for the money. My advice: spend the extra money and get the 12in version. 
- Filament - We could talk about this all day. My favorites are Polymaker, PrintedSolid, and Prusament. I just realized they all start with P. Weird.
