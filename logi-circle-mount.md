## Parts Used
I used this suction cup base from RAM Mounts and it is excellent. Best suction cup base mount I've used.

I took the hole spacing measurements from the base and did a ton of measurements with my digital calipers and came up with this design in Fusion360.

The base comes with two screws to attach your accessory, so I measured those and recessed them into the mount so they're flush with the top. 

More pictures coming soon.
