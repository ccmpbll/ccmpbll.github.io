## Welcome!
This space is dedicated to documenting all the stuff I find myself working on in my spare time. 

I might be the only one reading this, but I've been encouraged to document and track my side projects, so I've created this this platform to share my progress and findings.

While this space may not be flashy, it's a place where I can express my passion for continuous learning and problem-solving.

Thanks for stopping by!

## Current interests:
