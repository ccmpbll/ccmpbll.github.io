# 3D Printing and Design

- Printer - [Prusa MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/)
- Slicer Software - PrusaSlicer and [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer)
- 3D Design/CAD - [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal)
- Digital Calipers - [Neiko 01407A 6in Stainless Steel Digital Calipers](https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Electronic-Digital-Stainless/dp/B000GSLKIW/) - Yes you can buy better calipers, but not for the money. My advice: spend the extra money and get the 12in version. 
- Filament - We could talk about this all day. My favorites are Polymaker, PrintedSolid, and Prusament. I just realized they all start with P. Weird.
- Also, [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) is a must.
