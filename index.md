#### This is a place to document all the stuff I find myself working on when I'm not working. I realize no one is going to read this, but someone recently told me that I should document all of my side projects, so here we are. 

## Things I am currently interested in:
- 3D Printing and design
- Docker
- Monitoring and graphing tools
- Automation tools
- What I will call "general home lab nonsense"

## Check out stuff I made/created:
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ccmpbll)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ccmpbll)
