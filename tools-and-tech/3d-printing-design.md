# 3D Printing and Design Gear and Software

## 3D Printer
My current printer of choice is the [Prusa MK4S](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mk4s/). 

I started off with an Ender 3 and quickly found myself spending more time tinkering, tweaking, and tuning the printer than I was actually using it to print things. Eventually, I bought a Prusa MK3S+ and loved it. I have since upgraded to the Prusa MK4 and the [Prusa Enclosure](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-enclosure-3/). Great combination and I'm extremely happy with the new MK4. It's everything the MK3S+ was, just better. 

Update - December 2024: Over the last few months, I upgraded the MK4 to the MK4S and added the [MMU3](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mmu3/). Extremely happy with the results so far. I will add more info on this as time permits.

## Slicer Software
I have used [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases), [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer), and [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) but PrusaSlicer is my go to. With the latest few releases, they have continually improved things and added new features. I get great results with it. You can view the latest changes and additional features [here](https://files.prusa3d.com/?latest=slicer-stable&lng=en).

## 3D Design/CAD
I will admit that I am no expert here, but a good friend of mine talked me into trying [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) and I have never looked back. There is a bit of a learning curve for those of us that have never used real CAD software before, but once you learn how things work, it's a great tool to have.

I have been toying around with [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/), but have yet to make the switch. I like the UI, but I havent talked myself into paying for the license. I do not believe it to be quite as capable as Fusion, but time will tell. 

I have also played around with the latest release of FreeCAD, but I don't have enough experience with it to comment just yet. 

## Digital Calipers
If you plan to do any design, you will find very quickly that you need a good set of calipers for accurate measurement. I found these on Amazon a while back and they've been great. [Neiko 01407A 6in Stainless Steel Digital Calipers](https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Electronic-Digital-Stainless/dp/B000GSLKIW/). Yes, you can buy better calipers, but not for the money. My advice: go ahead and spend the few extra dollars and get the 12in version.

## Filament
We could talk about filament all day. My current favorite manufacturers are Polymaker, PrintedSolid, and Prusament. I just realized they all start with P. Weird. I have also had good luck with Overture, specifically their PLA. 

I normally stick with PLA and PETG. I have had extremely good results with both, especially with the last MK4S upgrade.

Silk filaments are terrible to print with and I don't like them. I believe it to be something in the way it's manufactured, but I don't like it. I have some and I use it when the mood strikes, but not if I have a choice.

## Other
[OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) is an absolute must. It integrates with Tasmota plugs to power on/off the printer, brings camera and timelapse support, and a host of other things. You wont regret it. Great opensource project.

If you are using OctoPrint, you definitely need [OctoApp](https://github.com/crysxd/OctoApp-Plugin). Best mobile app for OctoPrint, period.
