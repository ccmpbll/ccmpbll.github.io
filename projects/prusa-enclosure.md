# Prusa Enclosure Setup and Upgrades

## Summary
After upgrading from my beloved Prusa MK3S+ to a MK4, I decided the enclosure I built from Ikea Lack tables was no longer going to work. It was inexpensive and it was fun to build, but I needed more room inside the enclosure. Enter the official Prusa Enclosure. See below for some of my efforts to set the enclosure up to my liking.

## General Setup

### Details

I failed to take any pictures during the assembly process, but as with all things Prusa, the documentation is well done and I had no issues. The only part that I chose not to use was the printed feet for the enclosure. My enclosure sits on top of my small server rack, so I want to eliminate as much vibration and noise as possible. I chose to go with 2 packs of these Sorbothane feet and stuck them directly to the bottom of the enclosure. They've working very well so far. I would recommend using the 70 Duro feet as they are a bit more rigid and less likely to get completely squished by the enclosure. I put one on each corner and another 4 in the bottom center of the enclosure, directly under where the printer and quartz slab sit. 

The acrylic used for the sides and doors has a ton of static after you remove the protective paper and it attracts dust like crazy. I found this MG Chemicals cleaner that will remove the static and clean the surface. Worked extremely well. 

I won't bother creating a separate section for this, but its definitely worth mentioning. The hinged lid add on for the Prusa Enclosure is well worth the little effort and filament it requires. You can find details here: https://www.printables.com/model/273426-hinged-lid-for-adding-mmu2s-to-original-prusa-encl. It doesnt requuire any additional parts, only what is included with the enclosure kit.
