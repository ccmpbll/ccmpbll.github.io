### This is a place to document all the stuff I find myself working on when I'm not working. 
#### I realize that no one is going to read this, but someone recently told me I should document all the stuff I use/do/work on. 

## Things I am currently interested in:
1. 3D Printing and design
2. Docker
3. Monitoring and graphing tools
4. Automation tools
5. What I will call "general home lab nonsense"

## Check out stuff I made/created:
