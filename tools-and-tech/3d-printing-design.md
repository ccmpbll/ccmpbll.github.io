# 3D Printing and Design Gear and Software

## 3D Printer
My current printer of choice is the [Prusa MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/). I started off with an Ender 3 and quickly found myself spending more time tinkering, tweaking, and tuning the printer than I was actually using it to print things. I have never been more happy with a technology purchase in my whole life. This thing has been absolutely amazing. 

## Slicer Software
I use both [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases) and [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer), but PrusaSlicer is my go to. With the latest couple of releases, I find myself going back to it more and more and getting excellent results. The addition of organic supports and a few other features put it at the top of my list. You can view the latest changes and additional features [here](https://files.prusa3d.com/?latest=slicer-stable&lng=en).

SuperSlicer is great too, but I find myself only going to it for specific things. It has a lot more things to tweak and tune, if that's your thing.

## 3D Design/CAD
I will admit that I am certainly no expert here, but a good friend of mine talked me into trying [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) and I have never looked back. There is a bit of a learning curve for those of us that have never used real CAD software before, but once you learn how things work, it's a great tool to have. 

## Digital Calipers
If you plan to do any design, you will find very quickly that you need a good set of calipers for accurate measurement. I found these on Amazon a while back and they've been great. [Neiko 01407A 6in Stainless Steel Digital Calipers](https://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Electronic-Digital-Stainless/dp/B000GSLKIW/). Yes, you can buy better calipers, but not for the money. My advice: go ahead and spend the few extra dollars and get the 12in version.

## Filament
We could talk about filament all day. My current favorite manufacturers are Polymaker, PrintedSolid, and Prusament. I just realized they all start with P. Weird. I have also had good luck with Overture, specifically their PLA. 

I'm a big fan of PLA and PETG with embedded carbon fiber. Just make sure you have a hardened nozzle. 

Silk filaments are terrible to print with and I don't like them. I believe it to be something in the way it's manufactured, but I don't like it. I have some and I use it when the mood strikes, but not if I have a choice.

## Other
[OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) is an absolute must. It integrates with Tasmota plugs to power on/off the printer, brings camera and timelapse support, and a host of other things. You wont regret it. Great opensource project.
